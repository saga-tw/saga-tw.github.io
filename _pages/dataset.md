<span style="color:#be887b;font-weight:700;font-size:36px"> Comprehensive System Log Dataset for APT Attack Research </span>
<p>This dataset consists of system logs generated by SAGA from various Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack scenarios, designed to support cybersecurity research. It features two categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Known APT Campaigns: These scenarios based on cyber threat intelligence reports from real-world APT campaigns. Each scenario reflects documented attack techniques and lifecycles.</li>
  <li> Generated APT Campaigns: Using SAGA's random generation capability, we produced APT campaigns that simulate realistic APT attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following table illustrates an overview of the Known APT Campaigns dataset. Each campaign is associated with specific stages of the attack lifecycle and the techniques used in the attack.</p>
