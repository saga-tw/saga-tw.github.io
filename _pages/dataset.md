<span style="color: #2F4F4F; font-family: 'Work Sans'; font-weight: bold;font-size:40px">Comprehensive System Log Dataset for APT Attack Research</span>
<p style="font-family: 'Work Sans';">This dataset consists of system logs generated by SAGA from various Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack scenarios, designed to support cybersecurity research. It features two categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="font-family: 'Work Sans';"> Known APT Campaigns: These scenarios based on cyber threat intelligence reports from real-world APT campaigns. Each scenario reflects documented attack techniques and lifecycles.</li>
  <li style="font-family: 'Work Sans';"> Generated APT Campaigns: Using SAGA's random generation capability, we produced APT campaigns that simulate realistic APT attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-family: 'Work Sans';">The following table illustrates an overview of the Known APT Campaigns dataset. Each campaign is associated with specific stages of the attack lifecycle and the techniques used in the attack.</p>
